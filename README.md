## I trained an A.I. to beat Minesweeper.. without teaching it any rules!

Of course, since this is a Reinforcement Learning project, the above statement should be a given. After all, Reinforcement Learning is all about having a machine learning model improve through trial-and-error. Below is a comparison of a model playing Minesweeper before training and after training on ___ games!

### Introduction: The Game of Minesweeper <a name='intro'></a>

Minesweeper is a classic game of logic, dating back to 1989. The objective - click on all tiles except the ones containing mines. By clicking on tiles you reveal numbers which indicate how many mines are in the tiles around them. You progress through the game by revealing numbers and deducing where it is safe to click next.

*Can a computer learn to beat Minesweeper?*

Given the logical rules of the game, Minesweeper can be solved using brute force algorithms such as a combination of if-else statements. This means that a computer solver can be obtained by explicitly programming it to take specific actions from specific states. But can a computer *learn* to play Minesweeper without these clear-cut commands? In other words, can a computer learn the logic of Minesweeper without it being aware of the rules firsthand?

This is where Reinforcement Learning comes in!
